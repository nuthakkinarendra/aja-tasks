- For the Above infra, i want load-balancing to be configured.
- I want  Auto scaling for the 3 ec2's in order to avoid FT.
- These instances should be monitored and notificaitons should be in place !!

- Finally, The routing should happen via, ROUTE-53 using a Custom domain !

- IF any users browses the CDN, it should reach to app, where the app should collect user info and store it to the DB.
But, i want all the infra to be deployed in pvt-resources !!
